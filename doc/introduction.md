# Godot UI with XML

This library is designed to allow simple user interface (UI) scenes to be created using a basic XML syntax.

While functional, these scenes are not designed to be end-products, but to be a starting point for further customisation.

* [The elements](./elements.md)
* [Attributes](./attributes.md)
* [Meta](./meta.md)
